## DESCRIPTION
In this repository, I refactored the code I was presented.  
````````````````
Process:  
    - Listing out all of the HTML tags in order, then making sure all of the CSS tags followed that same order. 
    - Began to change the classes to elements, making sure to update the CSS document to reflect the changes in HTML document. 
    - While going throught the CSS tags, I noticed a lot of redundant tags, so I deleted the extra tags, and labeled each "area" with the "section" tag.  
        - I did the same thing to the small right column, but used the "article" tag.  
    - Examined the website for bugs. I noticed that the first link in the header was "dead" and was able to update/fix those links. 
    - Adjusted with the positioning of the HTML section and article tags, comparing any changes by viewing in the browser, to see if I could get both columns to align.
