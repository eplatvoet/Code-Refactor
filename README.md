# Assignment 1 - HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

 For this assignment, I began by listing out all of the HTML tags in order, then making sure all of the CSS tags followed that same order. I then began to change the classes to elements, making sure to update the CSS document to reflect the changes in HTML document. While going throught the CSS tags, I noticed a lot of redundant tags, so I deleted the extra tags, and labeled each "area" with the "section" tag. I did the same thing to the small right column, but used the "article" tag.
 Once that was complete, I then examined the website for bugs. I noticed that the first link in the header was "dead" and was able to update/fix those links. I then played around with the positioning of the HTML section and article tags, comparing any changes by viewing in the browser, to see if I could get both columns to align. Once I was able to get the proper number for the "margin-top" code on the right section, I compared to the physical look of the original document to check that it all matched up.

 ### INTERESTING NOTE:
 One thing that was noticed when discussing the assignment with other students was image size. Dan Karcher had pointed out that the images were massive & I had mentioned that I was having a difficult time getting the page to load quickly any time I tried to view in my browser. He was able to compress the images to a smaller size and share them, so the images didn't take so long to download on the internet (which would definitely appeal to the customer). I tried, but was not able to save them within the assest folder, so I would have to save them into another folder and link it to the document. I'm not sure if this was a hidden easter egg in the assignment or what not, but I thought it was definitely a good callout that the pictures were rather large, and I myself did notice that the page was taking quite a bit of time to load the images.
