For this assignment, I began by listing out all of the HTML tags in order, then making sure all of the CSS tags followed that same order. While going throught the CSS tags, I noticed a lot of redundant tags, so I deleted the extra tags, and labeled each "area" with the <section> tag. I did the same thing to the small right column, but used the <article> tag.

One I eliminated all of the classes and IDs, and created simple elements, I then examined the website for bugs. I noticed that the first link in the header was "dead" and was able to update/fix those links.

I then played around with the positioning of the HTML section and article tags, comparing any changes by viewing in the browser, to see if I could get both columns to align. 

One thing that was noticed when discussing the assignment with other students was image size. Dan Karcher had pointed out that the images were massive & I had mentioned that I was having a difficult time getting the page to load quickly any time I tried to view in my browser. He was able to compress the images to a smaller size and share them, so the images didn't take so long to download on the internet (which would definitely appeal to the customer). Something else Dan had mentioned was the meta tags for "description" and "keywords" so the website would be easier to access and also provide more information about the site.
