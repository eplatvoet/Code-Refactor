# Assignment 1 - HTML CSS Git: Code Refractor

 For this assignment, I began by listing out all of the HTML tags in order, then making sure all of the CSS tags followed that same order. I then began to change the classes to elements, making sure to update the CSS document to reflect the changes in HTML document. While going throught the CSS tags, I noticed a lot of redundant tags, so I deleted the extra tags, and labeled each "area" with the "section" tag. I did the same thing to the small right column, but used the "article" tag.
 Once that was complete, I then examined the website for bugs. I noticed that the first link in the header was "dead" and was able to update/fix those links. I then played around with the positioning of the HTML section and article tags, comparing any changes by viewing in the browser, to see if I could get both columns to align. Once I was able to get the proper number for the "margin-top" code on the right section, I compared to the physical look of the original document to check that it all matched up.
